1A.
After some experiments I can easyly say that raising the translation noise and 
the rotational noise will lead to loss of accuracy for the algorithm.
It can be noticed that amplyfying the translation noise, the particles are
distributed to the front and back of the robot. Looks like the particles are 
trying to predict the next possition of the robot.
The rotational noise is keeping the particles in a particular radius, also 
raising it, will cause the particles to spread out.
With a translation noise of 5px and rotational set to 0.5 rad, the location
of the robot is already unprecise, but still approximate. However at 10px of 
translation noise and 1rad of rotational, it is imposible to find the location 
of the robot.
1B.
Seting the rotational and translation noise to zero, will lead to complete
uncertainty of the location of the robot. The particles are centered in one 
point, changing the position over time and the robot never coincide with that 
point.
1C.
Seting the random distribution to 0.2 increases the accuracy of the algorithm. 
Whenever the robot apporaches a random distributed particle, the particles' 
probability is encreased, so there is a higher chance for other particles to 
appear near it, as for other particles that are left behind, their probability 
is decreasing and they dissapear over time.
Knowing that we can conclude that random distribution helps to predict future 
possition of the robot.
2A.
The particles are not always matching the robot possition. Due to the ambiguous 
world, everything is proportional. So the particles doesn't see what is after 
the corner, and also due to the same orientation as the robot, particles doesn't 
know what is in their back.
I concluded that the particles are amoving the same speed and the same way as 
the robot, but on a different maxima. They find a solution, but unfortunately it 
is wrong. The probability of getting a right solution is 25%.
2B.
The effect of setting the niching to sharing, is not desirable in our case. The 
niching method is good if in the world are more then one robot, so multiple 
solution is presented. With niching set to sharing, the particles are leaving 
the niche as the carrying capacity of it is exceded.
2C.
After some experiments we've noticed that the number of particles needed to find 
all 4 maximas is somewher between 700 and 800. Going deeper it showed us that the
precise number is 760. And this is 190 particles per robot.
2D.
Again even in the complex world, the particles are trying to find another robots, 
and because they do not exist in that world, the information about the location 
of the robot sometimes is wrong.
3A.
Whenever the robot is kidnaped, its' location is lost. Because the complex world 
is still composed of similar objects, the particles don't localize the robot right 
after kidnapping, since the particles compare the environment around them and the 
one around the robot, they can make wrong assunption of its' position in the world.
3B.
To solve the kidnaping problem it is good to place some random distributed particles 
over the world. Lets say setting P(rand dist) to 0.1 is already enough for particles 
to find the robot after kidnapping. Particles have the probability to reproduce, 
as it was mentioned before, whenever the robot is kidnapped it will appear in a 
place where already are some particles around. Comparing the environment around 
the robot and that particles, it will be simmilar, so their fittnes will raise, 
there fore more particles will apear nearby and will converge to a right solution.
