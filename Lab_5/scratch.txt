After some experiments I can easyly say that raising the translation noise and 
the rotational noise will lead to loss of accuracy for the algorithm.
It can be noticed that amplyfying the translation noise, the particles are
distributed to the front and back of the robot. Looks like the particles are 
trying to predict the next possition of the robot.
The rotational noise is keeping the particles in a particular radius, also 
raising it, will cause the particles to spread out.
With a translation noise of 5px and rotational set to 0.5 rad, the location
of the robot is already unprecise, but still approximate. However at 10px of 
translation noise and 1rad of rotational, it is imposible to find the location 
of the robot.
